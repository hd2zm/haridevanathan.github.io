I am an aspiring Data Scientist who will be enrolled in Metis's Data Science Immersive in 2019.

Previously, I was a Software Engineer who worked at some of the following companies. 

- **Microsoft** I was a full-stack developer in Javascript/ASP.NET. I worked on a variety of applications that included an IoT employee portal and a dashboard for partners. 

- **Epic** I was an IOS and ASP.NET developer. I created a text chat functionality in Epic's MyChart IOS Mobile, an application that allows patients to view existing medical records. This was done by interacting with the web application. 

- **UVA Chemical Engineering** I was a Python developer who helped design Intermol, an open source software package that converts between molecular dynamics file formats of various molecular simulation packages. I programmed input and output converters for Desmond (molecular simulation) files. 

- **Gannett** I was a full-stack developer in Javascript/Node.js. I collaborated with engineers on implementing CQRS and event sourcing for the microservice level architecture.
